This file will record my study progress of CS61A 22Fall, from Oct.8 to ....

Not sure when I will complete this whole course, but I would try my best to make it happen by January 2023.

I will upload my work on lab and assignment questions after I finish each lecture. 
Right now, I'm working on Lab00 to get familiar with the environment and requirements about submission and so on.

So, today is Day 1! For anyone who is also a beginner in Computer Science, welcome to join!
